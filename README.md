# DL for Disassortative Graphs
This repo collects papers developing deep learning methods on disassortative graphs.

Disassortative graphs refer to those with a low node homophily. In disassortative graphs, nodes with the same label could be distant from each other and nodes with distinct labels are more likely to be connected with edges.
